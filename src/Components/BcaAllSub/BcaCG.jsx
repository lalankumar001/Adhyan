        <h2>Computer Graphics?</h2>
        <p>Computer Graphics: - It is an art of drawing pictures, lines, charts, etc.  using computers with the help of Computer programming  And display on the computer screen. It is made up with the help of numbers of pixel. Pixel is the smallest unit of computer screen or picture. Picture is end product of the computer graphics.</p>
        <h4>Computer Graphics?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>It is an art of creating and manipulating pictures with the help of computer.</li>
            <li>It is made up with the help of smallest unit of pictures called pixel.</li>
            <li>Pictures is the end product of the computer graphics. </li>
            <li>Now Computer graphics is used in many different areas of industry Like- business, government, education and entertainment.</li>            
        </ul>
        <h3>Types of Computer Graphics:-</h3>
        <p>Basically Computer Graphics is divided into different parts-</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Interactive computer graphics.</li>
            <li>Non-interactive computer graphics.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><b>Interactive Computer Graphics:-</b></h4>
        <p>Interactive computer graphics is a two-way-communication between computer and user. The User  is given some control over the image by providing him with an input device and computer make changes or modify displayed picture when computer receiving signal from input device. With the help of interactive computer graphics user can also control animation by adjusting speed. For example ping-pong game , animating pictures or graphics in movies or videos , Graphics animation in video games.</p>
        <h4><b>Non-interactive computer graphics:-</b></h4>
        <p>Non-interactive Computer Graphics or passive computer graphics is a one-way-communication between computer and user. The user can only see the produced image and produced image can not be changed by the user.  For example: - T.V. , Screen Saver.</p>
         <ul>
             <li>In simple word the user can’t make any change on produced image because user  does not have any controlled over the image.</li>
             <li>Image will work according to the instructions given in the stored programs.</li>
             <li>It is also known as passive computer graphics.</li>
             <li>It is one-way communication between computer and user.</li>
         </ul>
